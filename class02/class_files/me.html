	<h2>Hello, my name is Denise. </h2>

	<p>I live in the Prospect-Lefferts neighborhood in Brooklyn. I commute purely by bike, unless there is flood-rains or crushing snow. I am also a proud member of NYC's first bike co-op, the <a href="http://bikecoop.nyc/">New York Mechanical Gardens</a>.</p>

	<p>On my commute, I like to listen to either podcasts or music. At the moment, I only have Beyonc√© on my phone, so that's my only music option (I do not want to waste data on Spotify). Podcast-wise, I try to find a new podcast a week, but on most days, I rotate between This American Life, Radio Lab, The Read, Freaknomics, Two Dope Queesns, Another Round, and Reply All. </p>

	<p>Also, I love The Matrix</p>

	<p>This is a very strange way to write about myself, but for sake of exericse, here we are. </p>
